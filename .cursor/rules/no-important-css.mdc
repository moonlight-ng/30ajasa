# No !important in CSS

Do **not** use `!important` in stylesheets. It is bad practice: it breaks the cascade, makes overrides harder, and leads to specificity wars.

## Instead

- Use more specific selectors (e.g. `.foot p` instead of `p` when targeting footer text).
- Order rules so later rules override earlier ones when specificity is equal.
- Use cascade and inheritance (e.g. set `font-size` on `.foot` and `font-size: inherit` on `.foot p`).
- Restructure selectors or add a single class rather than forcing with `!important`.

## Exception

Only consider `!important` for rare utility overrides (e.g. a single `.sr-only` or print rule) and document why it is necessary.
